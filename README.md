![Google Credentials Page](docs/google_crendentials.jpg)
- Select the Web application option at the top. You can provide a name for the client in the Name field as well. The name you provide will be displayed to users when they are consenting to your application acting on their behalf.

- if you’ll be running your web application locally for now, so you can set the Authorized JavaScript origins to https://127.0.0.1:5000 and Authorized redirect URIs to https://127.0.0.1:5000/login/callback. This will allow your local Flask application to communicate with Google.

- For Google Sign In to work, run the app on `https` using the command below:
```
export FLASK_APP=fitnessapp && export FLASK_ENV=development && FLASK_DEBUG=1 && flask run --cert=adhoc
